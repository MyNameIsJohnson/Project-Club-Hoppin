Title: Club Hop'n<br>
Type: Project<br>
Creators: Marcus Gillespie & Johnson Thieu<br>
Goal: Find Top Ten Clubs Of The Week

<hr>
## Planning
The first couple of days of the project, We worked on wireframes, mvps, to ensure a feasible implementation and concept of design.

<hr>
## The basic idea
Upon start of the app, the user's screen will begin with a populated list of clubs. The user can select a club, get details & location, and leave a review about that club.

<hr>
## The Review Page
For each club there is a review page:
* The User: the user can read reviews and leave their name and a brief review, detailing what they like/dislike about the club.
* Updating a Review. The user can change or edit a present or previous review.
* Deleting a Review: The user can also delete a review no questions asked.

## The UI and Branding
The concept behind the app was providing users suggestions for nightclubs in the area playing music of their choosing.

We both agreed we enjoy the night life and club scene but found we were always looking for a decent club in the area. We decided to develop an that would find the top ten popular clubs of the week that would guarantee it's user the best club hopping experience

## The Deliverable
The first couple of days we spent wireframing, constructing our mvp and planning for approval. After approval we separated the app into two parts, front-end and back-end. We both chose to work on the areas we needed improve on to build up our skill set. Some of our major acheivements were creating the routes and controllers, and connecting both the front and back end to make our app responsive.
