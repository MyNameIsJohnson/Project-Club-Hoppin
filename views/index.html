            Dramatic red lighting & burlesque art set the mood at this swanky lounge & late-night dance club. As local legend tells, the alleys of San Francisco’s South of Market district are named after the Barbary Coast era’s famous ladies of the evening, the HARLOTS. Deeply coveted and highly respected, the Harlot was admired for the services she provided. Time has passed, but the city’s lore remains. From her infamous dark alley, Harlot waits to please all who enter her doors.
